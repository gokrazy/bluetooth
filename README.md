This package provides support for using Bluetooth with gokrazy!

Note that general purpose Bluetooth would depend on userland utilities such
as bluez which requires C dependencies not supported in gokrazy. Still,
Bluetooth can be useful with native Go Bluetooth Low Energy libraries using
raw Bluetooth socket. This is not for everyone.

See [Userguide: Using Bluetooth](https://gokrazy.org/userguide/bluetooth/) for documentation.
